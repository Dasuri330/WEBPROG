                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi everyone! I am Dexter Cabubas, 20 years old. I am an aspiring photographer, traveler, video producer, and software engineer.
                    I am currently studying at NU Fairview, taking a bachelor's degree in information technology. Taking BSIT is not my first choice, my first choice was to become a doctor, but destiny did not lead me there in my dreams.
                    Maybe becoming a doctor is not for me, so that is why I'm here, taking the BSIT program. At first, I didn't want to take this course, but as the years went by, I enjoyed every time when I'm working on projects and coding. I want to become a software engineer or a cybersecurity expert someday. But honestly, I'm scared for my future because in my current year, I'm having a hard time with coding. My favorite programming language is <strong>JAVA.</strong></p>

                    <p class="my-hobbies">
                        My hobbies are playing video games specifically first person shooter like Crossfire or Valorant. I spent my time playing video games but not all the times, I play games when I have free time or am bored. Aside from that, I am a business-minded person. I don't want to be a company employee for the rest of my life. I'm planning to build my own IT company someday and collaborate with other defense companies to enhance cybersecurity, modern technology, radio communication technology, and many more. I can sing as well and I can play instruments like the guitar.
